This is my first time using Visual Studio's built-in git function. It may look a little different than before.

This program program has one input, a file name, which is inputted through the arguments when opening the program from the command line. The program then uses this file to count the character instances of A, E, I, O, U, W, X, and Z in the file. After counting, this information is then displayed to the user, along with the total count of characters counted in the file.
